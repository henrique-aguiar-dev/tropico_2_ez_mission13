Tropico 2 Pirate Cove campaign: Mission: A New War made easier

Changes made:
- A major difficulty in this mission is the lack of captives. A "shipwrecked mariners" event has been included in the mission which occasionally gives you 4 to 8 free captives.
- The cost of recruiting captains was reduced by 50%, from $2000 to $1000.
